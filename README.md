## Project description

Our project aimed to determine BUY-SELL signals for top performing US stocks using MACD indicators and TimeSeries analysis. 

- TimeSeries analysis was used to determine stock price 5-days moving forward

- MACD indicators were used to determine bullish or bearish movement in the market to reflect stock price strengthening or weakening

Besides, we also used Classification and Regression machine learning models to train and predict stock prices:

Regression models:
- Regression
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Extra trees
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Design

In summary, all R squares have a negative value in the models selected above, indicating that the Regression models does not follow the trend of the data, so fits worse than a horizontal line. It is usually the case when there are constraints on either the intercept or the slope of the linear regression line.

Classification models:
- Classification
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Ada Boost Classifier
- XGB Forest Classifier

## Conclusion

In conclusion, MACD prices are good indicators to generate BUY-SELL signals. However, other metrics such as Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and Fibonacci indicators should also be considered when making an informed decision to trigger a BUY or SELL.
