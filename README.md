## Project Overview
Our project aimed to determine BUY-SELL signals for any stock listed on the US Stock Exchange using Time-series analysis.

## Project description

- TimeSeries analysis was used to determine stock price 5-days moving forward

- MACD indicators were used to determine bullish or bearish movement in the market to reflect stock price strengthening or weakening

- Here, is that [MACD App](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1abuvNk-AlsIswHqVwza9GbKKlGb1UYDL) you can use to determine your BUY-SELL signal for any stock listed on the US Stock Exchange.


Besides, we also used Classification and Regression machine learning models to train and predict stock prices:

Regression models:
- Regression
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Extra trees
- Lasso Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Stochastic Gradient Design

In summary, all R squares have a negative value in the models selected above, indicating that the Regression models does not follow the trend of the data, so fits worse than a horizontal line. It is usually the case when there are constraints on either the intercept or the slope of the linear regression line.

Classification models:
- Classification
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Ada Boost Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier

In summary, for all Classification models we have low recall and precision values. This suggests, on average, our Classification models would be ~65% accurate which is not good enough to determine BUY-SELL signals when trading.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, MACD prices are good indicators to generate BUY-SELL signals. However, other metrics such as Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and Fibonacci indicators should also be considered when making an informed decision to trigger a BUY or SELL.
