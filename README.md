## Summary 

The kind of data you'd like to work with and the field you're interested in (e.g., trading, quantitative analysis).


Possible sources for such data.


Candidate machine learning or statistical models that you may want to explore.



This constitutes your Project Proposal and Outline, which should look something like this:

Our project is to predict credit card fraud. We'll fit a random forest algorithm to lending club data to create a predictive model. We will also fit a deep neural network model to the data, and compare the performance of both models to determine which has sufficient predictive power.
